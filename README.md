##Optimization Algorithms for Binary Classification Models



###About this project 

- This is the final project for the *Introduction to Optimization* course at CUHKSZ
- Several optimization algorithms are implemented for two binary classification models:
  - Linear Support Vector Machine
  - Logistic Regression
- Available optimization algorithms:
  - Gradient descent method
    - Armijo line search for step size
    - Barzilai-Borwein step size
    - Nesterov's accelerated GD
    - SGD
  - Second-order optimization method
    - Newton's method
    - L-BFGS
  - Adaptive method
    - AdaGrad
    - RMSProp
    - AdaDelta
    - Adam
- Dataset
  - Synthetic two-dimensional points
  - Dataset from the website LIBSVM
